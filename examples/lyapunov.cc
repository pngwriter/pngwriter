/* Lyapunov Exponents - A Test Program for PNGwriter
 *
 * Introduction
 * I want to show a real-life example of the use of PNGwriter.
 * This program will output an image characterizing the lyapunov exponents of
 * the logistic equation when the parameter R is not constant but a periodic series
 * of 2 values.
 *
 * What does that mean?
 * Take a simple equation, and iterate it (take an initial value, put it into the
 * equation, get what it spits out, and plug it in again to the equation, etc, etc).
 * This equation has a number in it somewhere called a parameter. Imagine you iterate
 * the equation 1000 times with the parameter at a certain value. You see if the resulting
 * series of points is periodic or chaotic. Moreover, you determine a coefficient that
 * depends upon this parameter, which tells you how chaotic the equation is for that
 * given parameter value. This is called a Lyapunov exponent.
 *
 * Was that too rushed?
 *
 * Ultimately the trajectory (the sequence of the resulting values of iterating the
 * function on an initial value) will be chaotic or periodic based solely on its parameter.
 *
 * Here's a 1-dimensional example:
 *
 * x_n is the nth iterate of an initial value, x_0, which is  a number between 0 and 1.
 * x_n+1 is the nth-plus-one iterate.
 *
 * Take
 *
 * x_n+1 = R * x_n * ( 1 - x_n )
 *
 * where R is this parameter.
 *
 * Take R = 2, for example, and you'll realise that the trajectory is periodic:
 *
 * Initial x_0 = 0.45
 *
 * 2*0.45* ( 1-0.45 ) = 0.49545
 * 2*0.49545* ( 1-0.49545 ) = 0.499959
 * 2*0.499959* ( 1-0.499959 ) = 0.5
 *
 * It converged to its steady-state solution in just 3 iterations.... subsequent iterations will give 0.5.
 *
 * This is because the equation is very stable for R = 2.
 *
 * This would mean that, if you plotted a line of pixels, each representing
 * a value of R from 0 to 4, you'd see varying degrees of red, black and blue
 * (following the convention that red is chaos, black is neither chaos nor stable and blue is stable.
 * Thus the pixel representing R = 2 would be quite blue.
 *
 * Imagine that instead of varying the parameter continuously from 0 to 4 (for example),
 * you replace this simple parameter with a series...
 * for example ABBB. This means that, for a given value of A (between 1 and 4) and a
 * given value of B (between 1 and 4) you can now iterate the equation first with A
 * as the parameter, then with B then with B then with B and then A again, looping
 * on until you do this 1000 times. You can calculate how chaotic this setup is for
 * these fixed values of A and B. Take A and B as your x-y coordinates, and the
 * lyapunov exponent as the colour value: chaotic is red, super-stable is deep
 * blue, and in between is black.
 *
 * That's where the image comes from!
