*                               PNG image pixel by pixel, which can
*                               then be opened with a graphics program.

    * This program is meant to serve as an introduction to using PNGwriter.
    * It is not the simplest possible use of it, and does not cover all
    * of its features. See the website for more examples.
    * This program will generate 4 PNG images. The first two will be
    * examples of using PNGwriter's figures.
    * The third will be an example of how to read an already existing PNG image.
    * The fourth will be an example of how to use plotHSV to generate a rainbow.
