INTRODUCTION
Hi. Thanks for downloading PNGwriter. I hope you find it
useful. See doc/english/CHANGES to see what's new.




DESCRIPTION
PNGwriter is a very easy to use open source graphics library that uses PNG 
as its output format. The interface has been designed to be as simple and 
intuitive as possible. It supports plotting and reading in the RGB 
(red, green, blue), HSV (hue, saturation, value/brightness) and CMYK 
(cyan, magenta, yellow, black) colour spaces, basic shapes, scaling, bilinear 
interpolation, full TrueType antialiased and rotated text support, bezier curves, 
opening existing PNG images and more. Documentation in English and Spanish. 
Runs under Linux, Unix, Mac OS X and Windows. Requires libpng and optionally 
FreeType2 for the text support.




REQUIREMENTS
LibPNG (http://www.libpng.org/)
PNGwriter requires a properly installed libpng in order to work.

Freetype 2 (http://www.freetype.org)
PNGwriter uses FreeType 2 to render antialiased text with kerning, but
it can be compiled without support for this. See below.

Fonts
If you are going to use PNGwriter's plot_text() function to plot text,
then you'll need a TrueType font file. PNGwriter installs a few from
the Free UCS Outline Fonts Project 
(http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freefont) in
/usr/local/share/pngwriter/fonts to get you started, or under whatever 
directory you chose with PREFIX at install time. See below. 




INSTALLATION
Before you do anything, check the 'make.include' file and make sure it is a
symbolic link to either one of 'make.include.linux' or
'make.include.osx'. 

The current setting to 'make.include.linux' should cover most systems,
including OS X. See below.

If you have an OS X system with libpng and FreeType2 installed via
Fink in /sw, or via MacPorts in /opt, edit and then use
'make.include.osx'. It is generally not necessary to use
make.include.osx on an OS X system if you are compiling with FreeType2
support. This is because the FreeType2 helper program freetype-config,
called at compile time, will actually provide the correct library and
header paths for your Fink or MacPorts distribution. In short, if
you're on OS X, just give make.include.linux a try, and if it doesn't
work, then tinker with make.include.osx


If you are using an old compiler, you may want to use
'make.include.linux.oldcpp', or alter your own makefile by adding
-DOLD_CPP to the compiler flags. 

If you wish to compile PNGwriter without FreeType2 support, then open
make.include with your text editor and uncomment the line that says

    # P_FREETYPE = 1

or, when compiling, add P_FREETYPE=1 to make's arguments.

Note that every time you compile a project that uses PNGwriter, and
PNGwriter has been compiled without FreeType2 support, you will have to
add -DNO_FREETYPE to your compilation flags.

To compile PNGwriter, just type

    make
   
and then, as Root, 

    make install
    
If you are not root, or do not want to install in the default
location (/usr/local/, set in make.include), then specify the location
with PREFIX when calling make, like this:

     make PREFIX=$HOME (for example)

or

     make PREFIX=$HOME/programming (for example)

The default installation locations are:

 -  libpngwriter.a in /usr/local/lib
 -  pngwriter.h in /usr/local/include
 -  The documentation in /usr/local/share/doc/pngwriter/doc/
 -  The examples in /usr/local/share/doc/pngwriter/examples/
 -  A few fonts in /usr/local/share/pngwriter/fonts

After installation, the following lines will list the installed
location of the software (determined from whatever PREFIX was at
install time):

 -  libpngwriter.a: /usr/local/lib/ 
 -  pngwriter.h: /usr/local/include/ 
 -  documentation: /usr/local/share/doc/pngwriter/ 
 -  examples: /usr/local/share/doc/pngwriter/ 
 -  fonts: /usr/local/share/pngwriter/fonts/

Look in examples/ for two examples of PNGwriter's use, and in
doc/english/EXAMPLES for an explanation.




SUPPORT
For examples, a FAQ, etc, take a look at the PNGwriter Home page:
